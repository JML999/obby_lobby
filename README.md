## Getting Started

1. Join the game
2. Type `/build` to enter build mode
3. Use `/block <name>` to select your desired block type
4. Look where you want to place a block and left-click
5. Look at blocks you want to remove and right-click
6. Type `/build` again to exit build mode and test your creation

## Development

This project extends the HYTOPIA SDK boilerplate with:
- Custom `ObbyPlayerEntity` for enhanced player functionality
- Custom `ObbyPlayerController` for mouse-based building
- `BlockPlacementManager` for block placement logic
- Raycast-based targeting system

## Architecture

```
index.ts - Main server entry point
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ ObbyPlayerEntity.ts - Custom player entity with building capabilities
â”œâ”€â”€ ObbyPlayerController.ts - Custom controller for mouse input handling
â””â”€â”€ BlockPlacementManager.ts - Block placement and removal logic
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Block behavior implementation (kill zones, bouncy blocks, etc.)
- [ ] Course save/load system
- [ ] Play mode vs Build mode separation
- [ ] Timer system for course completion
- [ ] Multiplayer course racing
- [ ] Course sharing and browsing
